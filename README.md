# SpaceGame-in-C-PlusPlus


This project is to help take what I've learned in C#, and apply it to the more difficult called C++.

This software is a game taking place in space.  You and one other person travel through space avoiding asteroids while trying to collect power ups to help survive.  The goal is simply to survive as long as possible.

{Below is totally a link to a video I totally created since the game is oh-so totally completed by now.}
